# 🧑‍💻 Portfolio – Alicja Buda

This is my personal developer portfolio – a space to highlight my favorite projects, technical skills, and passion for building thoughtful digital experiences.

The site was designed in Figma and built with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS, with an emphasis on clean layout, strong UI/UX and responsive design.
I also built a custom backend using Node.js and Express to handle the contact form securely, allowing visitors to reach out directly.

The goal of this project was not only to present my work but to reflect my approach to code: minimalistic, elegant, and crafted with attention to detail.
